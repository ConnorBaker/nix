# Changes between Nix and Determinate Nix

This section lists the differences between upstream Nix 2.24 and Determinate Nix 3.0.0.

* In Determinate Nix, flakes are stable. You no longer need to enable the `flakes` experimental feature.

* In Determinate Nix, the new Nix CLI (i.e. the `nix` command) is stable. You no longer need to enable the `nix-command` experimental feature.
